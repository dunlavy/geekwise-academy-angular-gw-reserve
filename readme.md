# geekwise-academy-angular-gw-reserve
Used for teaching, an Angular application coded largely in Fresnoâ€™s Geekwise Academy; we cover TypeScript, Angular templating, modules, components, routing configuration, forms, services and Firebase... among other things.

By the last day of class, students will have learned all the fundamentals to building a web application quickly from scratch.
